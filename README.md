The states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh emerged as the top 3 product buying regions, indicating strong market presence and customer base in these areas.

The adult age group (30-49 years) is the maximum contributing segment, responsible for approximately 50% of purchases. This age group represents the most valuable customer segment.

The majority of customer orders originate from Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra channels, underscoring the importance of these e-commerce platforms for Vrinda Store's sales.

# Final Conclusion

Furthermore, marketing efforts should be concentrated on specific geographical regions, primarily Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh.
